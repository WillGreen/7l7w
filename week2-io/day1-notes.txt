Example problems all seem to lead to pages on Seven Languages in Seven Weeks!
Is this problems as in exercises for Io programmers?
I found http://iolanguage.org/scm/io/docs/IoGuide.html, but it's not really problems.

Main discussion seems to be on Yahoo Group: http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/iolanguage/info

Io Style Guide: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Io_Programming/Io_Style_Guide


Io appears to be strongly typed:

    Io> 1 + 1
    ==> 2
    Io> 1 + "one"

      Exception: argument 0 to method '+' must be a Number, not a 'Sequence'
      ---------
      message '+' in 'Command Line' on line 1

Contrast with JS (node):

    > 1 + 1
    2
    > 1 + "one"
    '1one'
    > 


Io seems very like Ruby in its truthfulness. Almost everything is true:

    Io> if (0)
    ==> true
    Io> if (nil)
    ==> false
    Io> if (false)
    ==> false
    Io> if ("")
    ==> true

Sending an object a 'proto' or 'slotNames' message shows the slots a prototype supports.
Though 'proto' doesn't seem to work as expected on naked 'Object'. It shows Lobby, Protos etc.


Different sorts of equals:

=       assign to slot if it exists, otherwise throws exception
:=      creates slot if it doesn't exist and assign to slot
::=     creates a slot if it doesn't exist, creates a setter and assigns to slot
